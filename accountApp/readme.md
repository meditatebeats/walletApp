                                                                crypto ledger application (CLA)
This program is an early prototype that I plan to add cryptographic capabilities to. I plan to turn it into a crypto wallet that incorperates fuctionality directly from the command line.

CLA creates a class instance from main that takes in 3 arguments for its constructor.
